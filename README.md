# Simple Engine

A simple game engine. This is an educational project. The goals are as follow:

- Build a game engine in C++, using `vcpkg`, `cmake` and `Visual Studio Code`
- Use as many modern C++ integration tools as possible with the goal of keeping the code lightweight and minimal
- Unit testing capabilities (for learning - I don't know much about it myself yet)

Planned functions:
- 3D renderer - bgfx
- Input system  - SDL2.0
- Physics collisions
- Audio system
- 2D UI elements

Design principles:
- Robust memory management
- Probably avoid Singletons altogether
- Multi-threading

Timeline: None. This is for fun/learning.
